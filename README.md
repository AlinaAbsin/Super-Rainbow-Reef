## CONTROLS
Pop can bounce freely around the playing area besides the base and the area is enclosed by walls, and the player cannot control Pop's movement. The play can press the left and right key to control the Katch, and let it move horizontally along the base. Also the direction of Pop’s bounce is controlled by the collision point of Katch’s shell, and the player can control Pop's movement direction. When the player loses control to the Pop, the Pop will be out of screen and loses a life; the Pop will be back again and the player can keep playing. However, if the Pop loses lives three times, the game will be over, and the score will be displayed on the screen
